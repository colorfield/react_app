# React App for Drupal 8

React app boilerplate for progressive decoupling.

## Getting started

This boilerplate is based on the method adopted by the
[React Comments](https://www.drupal.org/project/react_comments) module.

### React

1. cd in js/src
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Edit App.js and your components
3. Run `yarn start` to start the development server
4. Run `php build.php` to prepare the dist js and css.

### Drupal

Head to /react-app/app to access the embedded React app.
